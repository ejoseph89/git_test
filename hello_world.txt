Open hello_world.txt, add some text to it, save it and stage it. You can use git add . to add all files in the current directory and all subsequent directories to the staging area. Then, type git status once more, and everything should now be in the staging area.

If you are using Visual Studio Code (and you should be if you’re following this curriculum) and you don’t want to get stuck writing a commit message in Vim because you accidentally used git commit without the message flag (-m), this command will make Visual Studio Code open a new tab with the ability to write your commit message and an optional description below it: git config --global core.editor "code --wait".
